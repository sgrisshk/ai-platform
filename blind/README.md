# Blind Discovery Agent

This runner creates a reproducible local boundary for official blind discovery. The normal ML
Engineer works in the repository and may see generator internals; that identity/session is never
eligible to execute a blind run. A Blind Discovery Agent starts fresh in a container that mounts
only an allowlist-built workspace outside the checkout. Blindness cannot be restored retroactively.

## Workflow

```sh
# Evaluator/coordinator identity, from the trusted checkout:
make blind-key-init RUN=run-001
make blind-image
make blind-rehearsal
make blind-issue RUN=run-001
make blind-verify RUN=run-001
make blind-shell RUN=run-001
make blind-freeze RUN=run-001
make blind-status RUN=run-001
```

Runs default to `/tmp/policy-blind-runs`; set `BLIND_RUNS_ROOT` to another directory outside the
checkout. The signing key defaults to `/tmp/policy-blind-evaluator/signing.key`, outside both the
checkout and run tree. `blind-key-init` creates it once with mode `0600`; it is evaluator-owned and
must never be sent to Discovery. `issue` refuses reuse, copies only regular files matched by
`blind/allowlist.yaml`, hashes them, and writes an evaluator-signed `BLIND_MANIFEST.json` into the
workspace. `verify` requires the external key and rejects an invalid signature as well as
missing, changed, additional, hidden, forbidden, Git, or symlink paths. `launch` verifies first,
rejects source/allowlist drift since issuance, requires the exact signed immutable image digest,
starts a new CLI process in Docker, and never resumes a session. `freeze` validates output schema
v1.1.0 and its signed dataset/contracts/splits/provenance/timing/language acceptance fields, records
hashes, copies them read-only to `frozen/`, and closes the state.
Evaluation is a separate trusted process and is not mounted or implemented here.

The official actor is deterministic Python, not an LLM or chat editor. It reads the signed
`BLIND_MANIFEST.json`, public analytical partitions, and allowlisted discovery engine, then writes
the three schema-v1.1.0 artifacts. The manifest supplies dataset identity, feature timing, outcome
metadata, contract versions, method version, seed, and input hashes; the executor has no
dataset-local private manifest and no hard-coded contract version.

Docker mounts the workspace read-only and overlays only `/workspace/output` as writable. The
container has a read-only root, no Linux capabilities, `no-new-privileges`, and network `none`.
Issuance rejects a provider model and launch rejects provider networking. The hard paid-usage
ceiling is zero requests, zero tokens, and zero cost. No provider credential or evaluator key is
passed. The retired Groq actor remains only as historical/tested code and is absent from the
official image; its generic child-Python helper also strips known provider API-key variables.

`make blind-image` builds the pinned `infra/docker/blind-agent.Dockerfile` with Python, Polars, and
Pydantic. The allowlisted executor and engine are signed workspace inputs. Issuance and launch
accept only `name@sha256:<digest>` and record the resolved image provenance. Before issuance,
`blind-rehearsal` creates a temporary signed allowlist-only workspace, launches the real executor
through the production Docker boundary, and runs normal freeze validation. It must print
`BLIND_REHEARSAL_VALID`; it neither creates an official run nor opens hidden truth.

## Threat model

| Threat | Mitigation | Residual risk |
|---|---|---|
| Accidental ground-truth access | Allowlist-only export plus forbidden-name scan | Misclassified public content |
| Generator reveals patterns | Generator/evaluator paths are absent and forbidden | Information encoded in approved inputs |
| Git recovers private files | No `.git`; standalone copy | Host compromise |
| Parent-directory escape | External run root and container with one mount | Docker/host administrator controls |
| Symlink escape | Source and workspace symlinks rejected | Container/runtime vulnerability |
| Method changed after results | Input hashes and frozen runtime | Agent can choose analysis details allowed by the method |
| Results changed after truth | Read-only frozen copy and SHA-256 provenance; ADR-008 signed receipt remains evaluator-owned | Host admin can rewrite local files; hashes expose it only if audit metadata is retained |
| Forged public issuance | HMAC-signed manifest verified with an external mode-0600 evaluator key before launch/freeze | Evaluator host compromise |
| Mutable or substituted runtime | Digest-only image reference, resolved at issuance and rechecked/recorded before `RUNNING` | Registry/runtime compromise |
| Checkout changed after issuance | Launch compares current allowlist and source hashes to signed snapshot | Deliberate reissuance required for any legitimate source change |
| Structurally incomplete output | Schema v1.1.0 and signed acceptance contract checked before freeze | Statistical validity still belongs to later validation |
| Actor modifies inputs or writes arbitrary files | Read-only workspace plus separate writable `output/` mount and exact output-name enforcement | Container/runtime compromise |

## Official TASK-015 issuance

All earlier provider-backed runs, including verified but unlaunched `…-014`, are immutable
audit-only artifacts and must not be reused after runtime/source drift. The deterministic runtime
is pinned as
`policy-blind-agent@sha256:9ad6e1a78ca41a7c04895d1d99c7775e77fc2c8fbb4f23cee268ed04534c7c9b`.
After `make blind-rehearsal` succeeds, the evaluator issues a new unique run and launches:

```sh
make blind-shell RUN=<new-run-id>
```

The coordinator supplies neither `BLIND_EVALUATOR_KEY_FILE` nor any provider credential to the
container. A failed launch permanently closes that run ID; issue a new run rather than retrying it.

This is credible local-development isolation, not absolute security against a host administrator
or a co-resident same-user process (see the CODE_REVIEWER note below), and not a claim of
bit-for-bit reproducible builds: `docker build` is only stable when reusing a warm local cache
(what `make blind-image` normally does back-to-back with `make blind-rehearsal`); a genuinely
fresh `--no-cache` build of the identical Dockerfile has been observed to produce a different
image digest (apt/pip layers are not pinned to snapshot-exact versions, and RUN-layer output
isn't reproducibility-normalized). `make blind-image` now fails closed instead of silently
accepting that drift: it rebuilds, compares the result against the pinned `BLIND_AGENT_IMAGE`
digest above, and errors out with the actual new digest if they differ, so re-pinning is always a
deliberate, reviewed step rather than an easily-skipped manual one. Keep the run directory and
evaluator-owned ADR-008 receipt together for audit.

**CODE_REVIEWER note (2026-08-17):** independent adversarial review of `HANDOFF-042` found and
fixed: (1) `docker` CLI subprocess calls in `tools/blind_agent/core.py` inherited the ambient
environment, so `DOCKER_HOST`/`DOCKER_CONTEXT` could silently redirect every isolation guarantee
here (`--network=none`, digest pinning, `resolve_image`) to a different daemon — calls now pin to
the local default daemon explicitly; (2) `agent="shell"` runs could reach `freeze()` with
hand-written outputs and pass the same contract checks as a real deterministic run — `freeze()`
now rejects any run not issued with `runtime_agent=deterministic`; (3) the reproducibility claim
above was corrected as described; (4) a workspace-integrity re-check was added immediately before
the container starts, narrowing (not eliminating) the same-user TOCTOU window between `verify()`
and `docker run`; (5) `tools/blind_agent/groq_actor.py`'s credential stripping (dead code today,
not shipped in the image) now matches a credential-name pattern instead of a fixed 4-name list.
Not fixed, and still open: `resolve_image()` trusts whichever local digest is asked of it — there
is no independently-audited "known good" reference beyond the pinned Makefile/doc values above,
so an attacker able to set `BLIND_AGENT_IMAGE` (or build their own image and get it accepted by
digest) is not caught by this layer alone.
