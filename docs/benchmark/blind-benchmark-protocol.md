# Blind synthetic benchmark protocol

## Problem

The repository contains both public benchmark inputs and restricted artifacts. A directory name,
CLI flag, or caller-supplied `status=PERSISTED` cannot prove that ML Discovery was blind or that its
candidates existed before hidden truth was opened.

## Current architecture

The full trusted checkout contains the generator, corruption manifest, hidden ground truth, and
evaluator. Generated public inputs and restricted files currently share that checkout.

## Proposed change

Use two execution identities and two workspaces:

1. A trusted coordinator creates a fresh blind workspace from a hard-coded file allowlist.
2. ML Discovery receives only that workspace. It does not receive the full checkout, evaluator
   signing key, generator implementation, corruption manifest, hidden truth, or evaluation code.
3. Discovery returns a candidate JSON containing the workspace `bundle_id`.
4. An evaluation actor accepts the bytes once and produces an HMAC-signed commitment receipt.
5. Post-hoc evaluation verifies both the receipt signature and candidate SHA-256 before opening
   hidden truth.

The workspace manifest hashes every supplied file. Workspace validation rejects additions,
deletions, modifications, symlinks, and known restricted filenames.

## Why

This is the smallest credible identity and commitment boundary. It uses filesystem workspaces,
SHA-256, HMAC, and role separation already available on developer machines and CI runners. The
receipt replaces unverifiable candidate metadata with evaluator-controlled evidence that exact
candidate bytes were committed.

## Alternatives considered

- Directory naming and documentation: not an access boundary.
- Candidate `status` and timestamp: controlled by Discovery and therefore not trusted.
- PostgreSQL audit tables: unnecessary before the discovery pipeline exists and still require an
  identity boundary.
- Separate repository, object store, or CI environment: stronger operational packaging, but more
  infrastructure than the MVP requires. The same allowlist bundle and signed receipt can later be
  transported through those systems unchanged.

## Dependency impact

No new dependency. The implementation uses the Python standard library.

## Migration impact

None. No database schema changes.

## Security impact

The boundary is valid only if Discovery is launched as a separate actor whose filesystem scope is
the blind workspace. Giving that actor the full checkout, the signing key, shell access to the
evaluation identity, or a previously contaminated conversation invalidates the run. HMAC is used
for provenance and commitment, not encryption. Hidden truth remains in the trusted checkout.

The public payload is limited to the versioned analytical partitions (`features`, `outcomes`,
`identifiers`, and `metadata`), TASK-012's `split_manifest.json` and `split_membership.csv`, plus
four generated, sanitized files under `public/`: schema, feature timing, approved outcome
metadata, and run configuration. Split membership exposes only booking ID/date, split label, and
the closed-benchmark outcome-finality flag. It contains no Python source.
`generation_config.json`, `corruption_manifest.json`, full lineage/missingness manifests,
raw/reference exports, private checksums, generator source, evaluator source, and all
`evaluation/` files are absent. Outcome metadata is serialized from the Statistics-approved
TASK-013 contract; the exporter does not invent or modify it.

## Rollback

Remove the blind-isolation scripts/module and return to the old evaluator signature. Existing
benchmark data and database state are unaffected. Previously signed receipts remain plain JSON
audit artifacts but would no longer be accepted by the reverted evaluator.

## Run blind discovery

One coordinator command rebuilds the benchmark and analytical dataset, then exports the public
artifact. It runs from the trusted full checkout; the destination must be new and outside the
repository:

```sh
make blind-key-init RUN=run-001
make blind-image
GROQ_API_KEY=<secret> BLIND_AGENT_MODEL=<approved-groq-model-id> make blind-provider-preflight
GROQ_API_KEY=<secret> BLIND_AGENT_MODEL=<approved-groq-model-id> make blind-rehearsal
make blind-issue RUN=run-001 BLIND_AGENT_MODEL=<approved-groq-model-id>
make blind-verify RUN=run-001
```

Start ML Discovery as a separate OS/container identity with
`/tmp/policy-blind-runs/run-001/workspace` as its only mounted workspace. Merely changing the working directory in
the full checkout is not isolation and invalidates the run. Do not fork a context that has seen
restricted files. The coordinator signature in `BLIND_MANIFEST.json` authenticates the issued
allowlist, output acceptance contract, and immutable runtime digest. Verification/launch also
compare the current allowlist and source hashes to the issued snapshot; any drift requires a new
run ID. Candidate commitment rejects unsigned, forged, incomplete, or modified manifests.

The repository provides a fail-closed container boundary for interactive execution:

```sh
GROQ_API_KEY=<secret> make blind-shell RUN=run-001 \
  BLIND_AGENT_MODEL=<approved-groq-model-id> BLIND_NETWORK=provider
```

The coordinator owns `/tmp/policy-blind-evaluator/signing.key` (mode `0600`) and invokes the
launcher after signature verification. The key path and bytes are not mounted or passed as an
environment variable. The signed manifest also fixes the Groq actor and explicit model;
launch fails if either drifts. The launcher mounts only the issued workspace, uses a read-only container
root, drops all capabilities, and sets `no-new-privileges`. Network is disabled unless the
coordinator explicitly selects provider mode; that mode has the local-runner egress limitation
documented in `blind/README.md`.
The pinned actor applies explicit completion, context, tool-output, and capped 429 retry budgets.
Source reads use 1-based inclusive pages of at most 250 lines; preflight exercises two sequential
paginated `read_file` turns under the same limits.
Issuance additionally requires a successful authenticated `blind-rehearsal` against the same
digest and model. The rehearsal uses a temporary truth-free workspace and production container
isolation to require listing, paginated reads, bounded literal search, Python execution, three
schema-valid dummy outputs, and bounded recovery from an injected `tool_use_failed`. It does not
allocate or mutate an official run ID.
The ML Discovery process/agent must be started inside that boundary; an agent already running in
the repository cannot be made blind retroactively.

Discovery writes schema v1.1.0 outputs defined in `tools/blind_agent/models.py`. The signed
`BLIND_MANIFEST.json.acceptance_contract` supplies exact expected values. In particular,
`candidates.json` binds:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.1.0",
  "status": "PERSISTED",
  "blind_bundle_id": "<BLIND_MANIFEST.json bundle_id>",
  "dataset_identity_sha256": "<signed dataset identity>",
  "input_provenance_hashes": {"<allowlisted path>": "<sha256>"},
  "selection_used_only_fit_split": true,
  "candidates": ["10-20 typed candidates"]
}
```

Fewer than 10 candidates are accepted only with `status=INSUFFICIENT_CANDIDATES` and a non-empty
reason. Freeze rejects contract/version/provenance drift, non-`DECISION_TIME` condition features,
unapproved outcomes/methods, incorrect split declarations, and prohibited causal language.

Discovery then returns only `candidates.json`. It must not receive any later messages or files from
the evaluation workspace until the receipt has been created.

## Run separate post-hoc evaluation

Use a separate evaluation actor in the trusted checkout. Generate and retain the key outside the
blind workspace; do not commit it:

```sh
uv run python scripts/commit_blind_candidates.py /path/to/candidates.json \
  --manifest /path/to/issued/BLIND_MANIFEST.json \
  --receipt artifacts/blind/run-001.receipt.json \
  --key-file /tmp/policy-blind-evaluator/signing.key
uv run python scripts/evaluate_synthetic_benchmark.py /path/to/candidates.json \
  --receipt artifacts/blind/run-001.receipt.json \
  --ground-truth synthetic_data/evaluation/hidden_ground_truth.json \
  --key-file /tmp/policy-blind-evaluator/signing.key
```

The commitment command accepts only a `PERSISTED` envelope tied to the issued blind manifest and
refuses to overwrite a receipt.
That status remains useful workflow metadata but is not trusted as proof: the signed receipt is the
commitment. Evaluation fails if the receipt is absent, forged, signed with another key, tied to
another bundle, or if a single candidate byte changed.
Archive the candidate file, receipt, evaluation output, and key in evaluator-controlled storage;
the key must remain unavailable to Discovery.
