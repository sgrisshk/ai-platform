    This is the canonical p-value source for gate G05 as of ``CONTRACT_VERSION >= "1.1.0"``

    empirical method's resolution floor of ``1/(B+1)`` cannot be adjusted below itself no matter
    how large the true effect is, which makes it structurally incapable of surviving
    Benjamini-Hochberg correction once ``family_size`` is in the low thousands. This function has
    no such floor — it is a closed-form transform of the standard normal tail via ``math.erfc``,
    resolvable in double-precision arithmetic down to underflow at roughly ``z ~= 38``
    (``p ~= 1e-315``), which covers every family size this system is expected to produce many
    orders of magnitude over. ``math.erfc`` (the complementary error function), not ``1 -
    math.erf(...)``, is what supplies that range: computing the tail as ``1 - erf(x)`` suffers
    catastrophic cancellation once ``erf(x)`` rounds to ``1.0`` in double precision, which happens
    already around ``z ~= 8.3`` — three-plus orders of magnitude short of the resolution actually
    available. See ``docs/analytics/validation-contract.md`` §4a for the precision derivation and
    the worked comparison of both formulations.

    The bootstrap procedure itself — clustering, replicate count, seed — is unchanged; only how a
    replicate set becomes a p-value changed. ``standard_error`` should come from
    :func:`bootstrap_standard_error` applied to the same replicates used for the confidence
    interval, so the interval and the p-value are consistent with each other.
