"""Deterministic feature-timing classification (TASK-008).

Classifies every profiled column (`policy_analytics.profiling.schema_profiler.ColumnProfile`,
`TASK-007`) into exactly one `policy_schemas.domain.FeatureTiming`: `IDENTIFIER`, `DECISION_TIME`,
`POST_DECISION`, `OUTCOME`, `METADATA`, or `UNKNOWN`.

Safety invariant this module exists to enforce (`ARCHITECTURE.md` §4, `AGENTS.md` shared rules):
only `DECISION_TIME` columns may ever become explanatory features. Every other classification —
including `UNKNOWN` — is excluded by
`policy_analytics.outcomes.contract.EXCLUDED_EXPLANATORY_CLASSIFICATIONS`.
That makes `UNKNOWN` the safe default: a column this module cannot confidently place is never
silently admitted as `DECISION_TIME`. `DECISION_TIME` itself is reached only through explicit,
disclosed positive rules below (categorical attribute, quoted/agreed amount, plausible booking-time
count, recognized flag, or a date with no post-decision-event name signal) — never as a catch-all
for "nothing else matched."

No ML/black-box guessing (`ADR-004`): every rule here is a plain, disclosed, whole-token name match
or a `TASK-007` profiler signal — nothing invented, nothing opaque, no dataset-specific hardcoding.
Column-name tokens are matched as whole tokens (`name.lower().split("_")`), never raw substring
containment, matching `schema_profiler._guess_semantic_type`'s own fix for the same class of bug
(`trip_duration` must never match a "ratio" hint just because "duration" contains it as a
substring).

This is a best-effort classifier, not a certainty oracle: real customer column names will not
always match these rules. `docs/analytics/discovery-design.md` §13's readiness gate independently
requires "feature timing contains no unknowns" before discovery may run on a dataset — i.e. any
`UNKNOWN` this module produces is expected to require explicit human resolution downstream, not to
be silently worked around here.
