"""Column mapping from a raw ingested dataset onto the canonical schema (TASK-010).

A mapping says which source column (if any) supplies each canonical field, plus how to coerce its
values. It is never invented automatically for real data: `suggest_mapping` proposes candidates
from exact/alias name matches only and is explicitly advisory (see its own docstring) — an actual
`ColumnMapping` used to canonicalize real customer data must be confirmed by a human, matching this
repository's rule that semantic meaning is never guessed silently (`ADR-004`,
`AGENTS.md`: "never allow unknown ... fields into explanatory features silently"). The synthetic
benchmark is the one dataset whose canonical identity mapping is safe to construct automatically,
because its column names already *are* the canonical names by construction.
