# Architecture and Product Decision Log

Only deliberate, durable decisions belong here. New entries are append-only; supersede an old decision with a new entry instead of rewriting history.

## ADR-001 — Modular monolith for the MVP

**Date:** 2026-08-13
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Deploy one Next.js frontend, one FastAPI backend, and PostgreSQL.

**Context:** The early MVP needs rapid iteration, reproducibility, and clear module boundaries without distributed-system overhead.

**Alternatives:** Microservices; event-driven services; serverless functions.

**Reason:** A modular monolith meets current scale and team needs with lower operational and coordination cost.

**Consequences:** Boundaries are enforced in code and documentation rather than network calls. New services require a demonstrated need and a new decision entry.

## ADR-002 — PostgreSQL is the default production database

**Date:** 2026-08-13
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy 2.x and Alembic. Do not use SQLite as the production/default database.

**Context:** The system needs robust relational integrity, JSON metadata, UUIDs, timezone-aware timestamps, and migration support.

**Alternatives:** SQLite; document database.

**Reason:** PostgreSQL covers current relational and metadata requirements without another datastore.

**Consequences:** Integration and migration tests require PostgreSQL. Schema changes must use committed Alembic migrations.

## ADR-003 — Polars is the primary dataframe engine

**Date:** 2026-08-13
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use Polars for deterministic data transformations; pandas is allowed only for necessary compatibility.

**Context:** Analytical transformations should be typed, efficient, and reproducible.

**Alternatives:** pandas as the default; Spark.

**Reason:** Polars is sufficient for MVP-scale analytical workloads without distributed infrastructure.

**Consequences:** New analytics dependencies require justification. Dataframe logic remains outside API routes.

## ADR-004 — Numerical truth is deterministic

**Date:** 2026-08-13
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** LLMs may assist semantic mapping, hypotheses, interpretation, and prose, but cannot be the source of numerical or statistical truth.

**Context:** Business policies must be reproducible and auditable.

**Alternatives:** LLM-generated calculations or unverified estimates.

**Reason:** Arithmetic, statistics, causal estimates, financial impact, eligibility, and backtests require executable deterministic code.

**Consequences:** Every reported number must have code, inputs, configuration, and lineage.

## ADR-005 — Explicit evidence taxonomy

**Date:** 2026-08-13  
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Findings use five levels: descriptive observation, predictive association, adjusted observational association, quasi-causal evidence, and experimental evidence.

**Context:** Pattern discovery alone cannot support causal claims.

**Alternatives:** Binary validated/unvalidated labels; unrestricted prose.

**Reason:** Evidence-aligned language prevents harmful overclaiming.

**Consequences:** API and UI language cannot exceed the assigned evidence level. Serious candidates require Statistics review.

## ADR-006 — Durable file-based project memory

**Date:** 2026-08-13  
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Maintain small, structured project memory under `memory/`, role contracts under `agents/`, and cross-role handoffs in `memory/HANDOFFS.md`.

**Context:** Multiple specialized agents need continuity without storing chat transcripts or speculative summaries.

**Alternatives:** Conversation-only context; unstructured notes; external knowledge base.

**Reason:** Repository-native memory is versioned, reviewable, portable, and close to code.

**Consequences:** Agents update memory only when information changes future decisions and follow the protocol in `memory/README.md`.

## ADR-007 — Preregistered validation and evidence contract

**Date:** 2026-08-13
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Fix the validation methodology before any candidate pattern exists. Contract v1.0.0 defines sixteen ordered gates, their thresholds, cumulative requirements per evidence level, permitted language per level, and the policy-readiness matrix, in `docs/validation_contract.md` and `packages/analytics/src/policy_analytics/validation/`. Changing a threshold requires a new contract version and re-grading of every finding produced under the old one.

**Context:** A validation standard chosen after seeing results is not a standard. Candidate patterns are search results whose default explanation is leakage, confounding, selection, or the size of the search, and the rules that reject them must be fixed in advance.

**Alternatives:** Case-by-case statistical judgment; thresholds tuned per finding; a binary validated/unvalidated flag.

**Consequences:** A finding cannot claim an evidence level its gate results do not support — `ValidationReport` re-derives the level and refuses inconsistent reports. Unevaluated checks count as failures, so missing upstream inputs cap evidence rather than being waived. Observational data caps this product at `adjusted_observational_association`; levels 4 and 5 require a design, and `HIGH_CONFIDENCE` readiness is unreachable until policy backtesting exists. False-discovery control uses the number of hypotheses discovery evaluated, not the number it reported, which makes the discovery run manifest a hard dependency of evidence grading.

## ADR-008 — Allowlist workspace and signed commitment for blind discovery

**Date:** 2026-08-13
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Run synthetic blind discovery under a separate execution identity in a generated,
allowlist-only workspace. Before hidden truth is opened, an evaluation identity commits the exact
candidate bytes with an HMAC-signed receipt containing their SHA-256 and blind bundle ID.

**Context:** Restricted and public benchmark artifacts coexist in the main checkout. Directory
conventions and Discovery-controlled persistence metadata do not enforce blindness or temporal
commitment.

**Alternatives:** Documentation-only separation; caller-supplied timestamps; a database audit
table; separate repositories/object storage/CI environments.

**Reason:** A generated workspace plus evaluator-owned signature creates the required access and
commitment boundaries using only local files and standard cryptography, without premature
infrastructure.

**Consequences:** A credible blind run must never give Discovery the full checkout or signing key.
Candidate evaluation requires a valid receipt and fails after any candidate modification. The
protocol can later use CI artifacts or external storage without changing its file contracts.

## ADR-009 — Preregistered outcome definition contract

**Date:** 2026-08-13  
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Fix, before any discovery run, which outcome is primary for the first blind benchmark, its harm direction, unit, missing-data policy, and eligible cohort. Primary outcome is `contribution_margin_eur` (EUR per booking; a decrease relative to the comparison group is harmful); six secondary/decomposition outcomes are defined; `repeat_purchase_180d` is exploratory-only and MNAR-bounded. Contract v1.0.0 is pinned to the delivered analytical dataset `travel-bookings-analytical-v1.0.0` by its identity hash, in `docs/outcome_contract.md` and `packages/analytics/src/policy_analytics/outcomes/`.

**Context:** `TASK-015`/`TASK-016` (ML Discovery) require a single, unambiguous target to rank candidates against. Choosing or reweighting the outcome is a business-semantics decision Discovery is not authorized to make (`agents/ML_DISCOVERY.md`), and doing it after seeing candidates would let the target be chosen to fit a result.

**Alternatives:** Let Discovery choose or infer an outcome per run; use multiple co-primary outcomes without a sign convention; use `repeat_purchase_180d` or `gross_profit_eur` as primary.

**Reason:** `contribution_margin_eur` is the only outcome in the schema netting out every downstream cost component present in the data and the only one with verified zero missingness, removing an entire bias family (outcome-dependent missingness) from the primary analysis. `repeat_purchase_180d` has empirically confirmed missing-not-at-random structure (9.72% overall, 45.7% among cancelled bookings vs. 7.2% otherwise) and cannot serve as a primary target without inventing a customer-lifetime-value model this repository does not have.

**Consequences:** ML Discovery ranks candidates using the fixed harm-score sign convention (`harm_multiplier`) and the deterministic, unadjusted `historical_exposure` formula in `aggregation.py`; it may not invent a different target or sign. Findings built on secondary/mechanism outcomes are reported as explanatory, never summed with primary-outcome impact. This is a benchmark-scoped decision only — `OQ-002` (the real-customer outcome) remains open and requires its own Product/Customer Discovery input plus a right-censoring/maturation design this closed 24-month benchmark did not need.

## ADR-010 — First-pilot customer acquisition is tracked, top-priority active work

**Date:** 2026-08-13
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Add `TASK-057` (Secure first real pilot customer) to the registry as explicit `P0` work, owned by Customer Discovery with Founder Strategy support, tracked in parallel with and equally urgent to the ingestion-contract critical path (`HANDOFF-001`). `TASK-037`'s dependency is corrected from the informal "Real customer agreement" to `TASK-057`.

**Context:** A repeatability assessment was requested under the label "TASK-044"; the registry's actual repeatability task is `TASK-045`, gated by `MILESTONE-M3`. Investigation (`HANDOFF-014`, Founder Strategy → Customer Discovery) found zero real customer evidence anywhere in this repository — no agreement, dataset, interview, or finding — because Phase 14 (`TASK-037` onward) treated "real customer agreement" as an unowned precondition rather than active tracked work with an owner and a done condition.

**Alternatives:** Continue treating customer acquisition as an implicit precondition outside the task registry; keep sequencing downstream build work (validation, findings UI, policy backtesting) while acquisition happens informally, untracked.

**Reason:** The core hypothesis can only be tested against real customer data. Build work beyond what a credible first pilot requires has no evidence value until at least one real dataset exists. Making acquisition an owned, done-conditioned `P0` task prevents it from being silently deprioritized in favor of engineering work that produces easier, more visible progress.

**Consequences:** `TASK-037` now formally depends on `TASK-057`. `TASK-045` (repeatability assessment, i.e. the requested "TASK-044") stays `BLOCKED`, and no go/no-go verdict on repeatability, pricing, or fundraising traction will be produced before `MILESTONE-M3` succeeds. Founder Strategy tracks `TASK-057` alongside the ingestion-contract critical path as a joint top priority.

## ADR-011 — Outcome contract v1.1.0: explicit discovery-time statistical contract

**Date:** 2026-08-13
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Extend the outcome contract (ADR-009) to v1.1.0 without reopening the primary-outcome choice: add an empirically verified `valid_range` per outcome, an explicit no-winsorization/no-transformation-at-discovery rule, an explicit per-outcome aggregation rule, and a machine-readable `DiscoveryStatisticalContract` (`DISCOVERY_CONTRACT` in `packages/analytics/src/policy_analytics/outcomes/contract.py`) fixing the search-fit split, the minimum-support floor, excluded explanatory-variable classifications, and missing-outcome handling for discovery specifically — as distinct from validation's later treatment of the same concerns.

**Context:** The v1.0.0 contract fixed *what* the outcome is but left several discovery-time operating rules implicit or split across the outcome and validation contracts: how to detect an anomalous outcome value, whether transformations are permitted before ranking, which split candidates may be tuned on, and what the minimum support for even proposing a candidate is. `TASK-015` had already run and, by inspection, complied with every one of these rules in practice — but compliance was accidental (a consequence of good engineering judgment), not contractually required, which is not sufficient for a preregistered contract meant to bind future runs and future agents.

**Alternatives:** Leave these rules implicit in code comments and prior conversation; duplicate the validation contract's support floor as a second, independently maintained number; let ML Discovery infer the search-split rule from the split labels without an explicit prohibition on using later splits to select candidates.

**Reason:** A rule that is only true by accident stops being true the next time someone runs discovery without having read this exact history. The support floor is imported from the validation contract's own `ValidationThresholds.min_exposed_records`, not restated, so the two cannot silently drift to different numbers. The search-split rule is stated explicitly because using `validation`/`future_holdout` to select candidates would invalidate the validation contract's own temporal-stability gate (G10) by leaking the exact period that gate is designed to test.

**Consequences:** `TASK-015`'s existing persisted candidates (`artifacts/discovery/task-015-candidates.json`) were checked against every new rule and found compliant: all 15 candidates use only `DECISION_TIME` features, all have `n_exposed >= 50` on development, and conditions were fit on development only. No rerun is required. Any future discovery or ranking run must construct its statistical contract from `DISCOVERY_CONTRACT`, not from local judgment. `valid_range` values are empirical claims about the pinned dataset instance and are re-verified by `tests/analytics/test_outcome_contract.py` against the live artifact; they must be re-derived, not copied, if the dataset is regenerated.

## ADR-012 — Pre-registered benchmark decision gate (STRONG/PROMISING/WEAK/FAILED)

**Date:** 2026-08-13
**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Before the first blind discovery run (`TASK-017`) is scored, fix a business decision gate — `BENCHMARK_DECISION_GATE.md` — that converts `TASK-028`'s six metrics (Top-K precision, economic-weighted recall, confounder trap rejection, leakage violations, effect direction accuracy, economic impact estimation error) into one of four verdicts and a bound action: STRONG → proceed toward real customer data; PROMISING → one targeted synthetic iteration, no approach change; WEAK → no real data, iterate; FAILED → no real data, and after two failed independent runs on the same metric with a confirmed non-fixable cause, a mandatory core-discovery-approach review. Any leakage violation, any promoted confounding trap, or any materially-sized wrong-direction finding is a hard disqualifier that forces FAILED regardless of the other five metrics.

**Context:** Ground truth (`synthetic_data/evaluation/hidden_ground_truth.json`) is confirmed unopened as of this commit — `TASK-017`/`TASK-028` are `BLOCKED`, and `TASK-015` was reverted to `BLOCKED` pending a rerun against the current pinned dataset identity and formal `TASK-012` split contract. `docs/validation_contract.md` §10 already fixes a qualitative acceptance test for the validation methodology, but nothing translates its output into a founder-level go/no-go on spending a real customer relationship on this mechanism. Recording the criteria after seeing results would let success standards move to fit whatever the run produced, which the discipline in `ADR-007` explicitly exists to prevent.

**Alternatives:** Grade the benchmark informally after the fact; let Statistics' per-finding evidence levels alone stand in for a benchmark-level verdict; wait for a real customer dataset before defining what "good enough" means.

**Reason:** The two cheapest, most decision-relevant unknowns for this company are whether the mechanism works and whether a customer exists (`30_DAY_VALIDATION_PLAN.md`). This gate makes the first one falsifiable and immune to post-hoc goalpost-moving, at zero customer cost, before any real data is touched.

**Consequences:** No real-customer dataset may be ingested (`TASK-038`) on the strength of a benchmark run graded below STRONG or PROMISING-with-improvement under this gate. The tier thresholds are Founder-set business judgment; `HANDOFF-027` asks Statistics to confirm they don't conflict with `docs/validation_contract.md` before `TASK-028` runs. `BENCHMARK_DECISION_GATE.md` is append-only after this date — results are added under its "Post-benchmark comparison" section, never substituted into the criteria above it.
