# Current Project State

**Last updated:** 2026-08-13

## Current objective

Build the trustworthy ingestion and evidence contracts required to test whether historical travel-booking decisions contain previously unknown, economically material, actionable patterns.

## Current customer context

Initial use case: travel agency pilot. No real customer dataset is stored in this repository, and no customer dataset has yet been profiled by the implemented pipeline.

## Current stage

Repository bootstrap complete; ingestion-contract design is next.

## Current hypothesis

Historical decision/outcome data may contain actionable interaction patterns the business does not currently recognize. This remains a hypothesis, not a validated finding.

## Current product scope

CSV/Excel export → immutable ingestion → data quality and canonical schema → leakage-safe analytical dataset → interpretable candidate discovery → statistical validation → finding report → policy candidate.

The repository currently implements the platform foundation, metadata APIs, persistence, migrations, frontend shell, synthetic fixture, and delivery controls. It does not implement the analytical pipeline.

## Explicit non-goals

- CRM integration
- autonomous policy enforcement
- agent runtime/governance platform
- universal business graph
- enterprise SSO, billing, or multi-tenancy in the bootstrap
- production causal claims
- distributed infrastructure without demonstrated need

## Current blocker

No immutable ingestion contract or canonical travel-booking mapping exists. Real customer data must not be accepted until security, storage, validation, and deletion boundaries are defined.

## Next milestone

Build the hidden-ground-truth synthetic benchmark while approving the immutable ingestion and statistical evidence contracts (`TASK-003`, `TASK-005`, and `TASK-018`).

## Success criterion

The later pilot succeeds only if at least one validated finding is new, economically material, and actionable to the customer. The immediate milestone succeeds when a synthetic upload can be transformed reproducibly with complete data-quality and time-availability reporting.

## Kill signal

Across multiple suitable datasets, the system repeatedly produces only obvious, unstable, economically immaterial, or non-actionable relationships.
